# Map, Reduce, and Friends

## Overview
The purpose of this month's meetup is to explore Map, Reduce, Filter, and other related functional operators, and how they can help solve everyday problems.

You often have to iterate over collections of data, taking certain actions on each entry in the collection, perhaps transforming the entries, and sometimes accumulating them into an aggregate result. You'd traditionally use loops and iterators to do this in an imperative style of programming, but in most modern languages, you can use a more functional approach which has many advantages.

# Solutions
See solutions in different languages in the "Solutions" directory. Once you decide which language you'd like to use,
simply open that directory in your favorite IDE, and you should be able to run the included unit tests "out of the box". This month, you'll first run the tests to make sure they all pass, and after exploring the code, you'll refactor it to use `map`, `reduce`, `filter`, and other language constructs, while maintaining passing unit tests. Feel free to explore one or more of the languages - while there are similarities, there are also features that are unique to each one.

The recommended IDEs are as follows, but feel free to use whatever IDE you are comfortable with.
